- Goal: Fix backend import compatibility with latest LangChain packages.
- Change: Updated imports in `backend/app.py`; added missing packages in `backend/requirements.txt`.
- Result: `import app` works and `uvicorn app:app` starts.
- Risk: Runtime quality still needs evaluation set.
- Next: Add a small QA evaluation script and baseline metrics.
